# About Me
- 👋 Hi there! I'm Marian Estrada, a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer with a focus on automation testing. With my experience in software QA testing and debugging code, I have honed my skills in developing and executing test plans, analyzing and documenting test results, and identifying defects. I have worked extensively with Cypress, Testrail, and Github Actions, and integrated them to improve test coverage and effectiveness of the test automation process. Additionally, I have experience managing teams of QA testers and support personnel, as well as creating and implementing efficient test automation frameworks.
